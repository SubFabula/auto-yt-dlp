"A feature-rich command-line audio/video downloader" "...with a simple graphical interface".

# About the Project
If you, the person that is reading this right now somehow found this repository, know that this WILL hopefully be a community driven project.

But for the time being, i will be both developing this myself to... well, develop it of course (with poor schedule since school and whatever) and also teach myself programming. Because, if I'm real (lazy and didn't really care much about learning), i could have copied the whole [`auto-py-to-exe`](https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe) repository to this one and then just re-programmed everything to work with [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and be done with it ¯\\_\(ツ)\_/¯

# Note
If you want to test this yourself at the current state, just do this:

1. Download just the [`auto_yt_dlp`](https://github.com/SubFabula/auto-yt-dlp/tree/main/auto_yt_dlp) module to your machine.

2. Assuming you have `Python`, locate your `Python` folder, and then go into the `libs` folder (the separate one would also do if you have that).

3. Now, put the downloaded module into the `libs`. And open command prompt `(Ctrl + R -> cmd)`.

4. If everything is working as indented, if you do `python -m auto_yt_dlp` in the command prompt, the app wil start.

# TODO
- [x] Make the app launch-able from CMD.
- [x] Make the app and CMD exit together. 
- [x] Desing the UI(WIP but whatever).
- [ ] Make the app input CMD codes and run it (after the UI is done, somewhat, which is now).
- [ ] Add every other option of [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) (after getting the CMD to work from Python without issues).
